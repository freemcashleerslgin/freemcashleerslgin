Payday loans are available online and from storefront lenders in states that allow them. Once approved, borrowers usually get the funds the same or next day.

When you get a payday loan, you sign a contract that outlines the loan’s APR and repayment terms. On the due date, the lender will withdraw payment from the account where your income is deposited, or you’ll repay the loan in person.
