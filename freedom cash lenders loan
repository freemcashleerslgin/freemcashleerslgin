Personal installment loans can come from banks, credit unions or online lenders. Many personal loan lenders let you pre-qualify online with a soft credit check. This process lets you check your potential loan amount, rate and repayment term without affecting your credit score.

You can pre-qualify with multiple lenders to gauge your likelihood of approval before applying. Once you apply, the lender will do a hard credit check.

Approval can be instant or take a couple of days. Once approved,  youâ€™ll sign a contract that details the APR and repayment terms. It typically takes a day or two for the lender to send loan funds after approval.

Repayment typically starts 30 days after you sign a loan agreement. Most installment lenders put borrowers on a monthly repayment schedule.
